When they open backup for repopulation it will most likely be a soft closure to residents with ID's only. I want to also thank all the LE agencies that have been patrolling. They were able to stop several people on parole and probation with fake E numbers going into the evacuation area.

We are not sure where Mark Lazarus is getting his figures, but HCPD sources state there have been less murders in the last 18 months, than the entire last year of Mr. Lazarus' term as Chairman!

He seems to be blaming Chairman Gardner for Covid lockdowns, uncontrolled growth, and traffic gridlock... but COVID lock downs were the result of a WORLDWIDE PANDEMIC, the growth issue was due to the lack of concern for the Horry County Citizen, in order to line pockets of developers (started by the Lazarus regime), and traffic gridlock due to the Lazarus regime holding money back to fund I-73 (which neither the State, nor Feds wanted to fund).

As you read further, he seems to insinuate that gas and grocery prices and inflation is caused by Chairman Gardner...these three issues are on a FEDERAL level and CANNOT be controlled by LOCAL government.  

In the last four years, the Horry County Police Budget has grown by $25 MILLION! Horry County Employee MORALE, is 100% BETTER than under the Lazarus regime! Employees are not leaving in droves, as they did four years ago. Horry County is finally taking care of the employees that keep this County safe and running! 

I challenge each citizen to ask any employee, howbthey feel about they way they would compare the two regimes...we would GUARANTEE THAT THEY WILL TELL YOU TO...

RE-ELECT ""THE PEOPLE'S CHAIRMAN,"" JOHNNY GARDNER!!!!

The ONLY Horry County Council Chairman that has stood by and fought for the employees, for the entire term of office!!

We chose the Tiger because Tigers stand for strength, power, courage, and ambition. The animal represents a symbolic release of fears and standing for truth, justice, and integrity.

Last year was very challenging but with the help from the communities, volunteers,vendors , performers, Mayor Kevin Hartke and especially from Niki Tapia and her team from the diversity group, our 2021 Chandler Asian Festival was a success. 

We are working hard to make 2022 Chandler Asian Festival a even more of a success, and with your help, we will.",

                    PLEASE BE ADVISED

Hwy 84, known as Commerce Street in the Fairfield city limits, will be closed during the Freestone County Parade. The parade will start at 7pm sharp and should conclude around 8:30pm.
During this time, there will be a detour route set up in order for traffic to continue moving safely.
The following information is being provided to better assist you with your travels : 
Detour for those traveling West to East:
* From Fairfield take Hwy 75 South to FM 489. Take FM 489 all the way until you get back to East Hwy 84. 
* From Teague take FM 179 all the way to Dew where it meets FM 489 at the 4-Way Stop. Take FM 489 all the way until you get back to East Hwy 84.(Unless your destination is on Hwy 75 in or towards Fairfield) 

Detour for those traveling East to West:
* From Butler/Oakwood take FM 489 and follow FM 489 all the way to the 4-Way Stop in Dew. At this point you can take Hwy 75 North toward Fairfield or you can take FM 179 from Dew to Teague.

** We recommend all semi, big trucks and trailers, and any oversized loads find a safe place to pull over or park until the main roads through Fairfield are open back up. We prefer you be in a parking lot of a hotel, restaurant, or truck stop in order for remaining traffic to continue to flow safely.

** FM 1580, known as Post Oak Road, is closed to through traffic due to bridge maintenance. This is not a detour route and you will not be able to get through. 

** Deputies will be located in Dew at the 4-Way Stop to control traffic and assist if needed.",

I am heartbroken for people around this country who just lost the fundamental right to make informed decisions about their own bodies.

I am heartbroken that we may now be destined to learn the painful lessons of a time before Roe was made law of the land—a time when women risked losing their lives getting illegal abortions. A time when the government denied women control over their reproductive functions, forced them to move forward with pregnancies they didn’t want, and then abandoned them once their babies were born. 

That is what our mothers and grandmothers and great-grandmothers lived through, and now here we are again. 

So yes, I am heartbroken—for the teenage girl, full of zest and promise, who won’t be able to finish school or live the life she wants because her state controls her reproductive decisions; for the mother of a nonviable pregnancy who is now forced to bring that pregnancy to term; for the parents watching their child’s future evaporate before their very eyes; for the health care workers who can no longer help them without risking jail time. 

When we don’t understand our history, we are doomed to repeat its mistakes. In this country, our futures are tied together in a delicate tapestry that we each have a hand in making. Too often, cynicism or indifference makes us feel like we don’t have a say in weaving it, but that couldn’t be further from the truth. The more we allow pessimism to push us further into helplessness, the less we will be empowered to help create the kind of country we want to live in.  

This horrifying decision will have devastating consequences, and it must be a wake-up call, especially to the young people who will bear its burden. I know this is not the future you chose for your generation—but if you give up now, you will inherit a country that does not resemble you or any of the values you believe in. 

This moment is difficult, but our story does not end here. It may not feel like we are able to do much right now, but we can. And we must. 

If you’re like me and you want to get started right now, I encourage you to channel your frustration and anger into action by getting involved. Organizations like Planned Parenthood and The United State of Women, among many others, have resources you can look to if you want to help others or if you need help yourself. 

Our hearts may be broken today, but tomorrow, we’ve got to get up and find the courage to keep working towards creating the more just America we all deserve. We have so much left to push for, to rally for, to speak for—and I know we can do this together.

The Pismo Clams are making a big comeback! Yay! If you see them, look and admire but let them be. It takes them 10 years to mature! I posted the sign with the regulations at the end of this post in case you wanted to know details. It was fun walking around and seeing the beach thriving with life. Hope you enjoy the pics.
