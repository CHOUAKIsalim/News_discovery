The award is reserved for those who make substantial contributions to restoring salmon and steelhead in the Upper Columbia region, an Oct. 5 UCSRB press release said. Ward served as a UCSRB Director for two decades, working to build meaningful, lasting relationships with diverse partners and to find solutions that worked for all parties. He understood, as did then Chelan County Commissioner Esther Stefaniw, that a solid foundation of collaboration between stakeholders would be critical to the long journey of salmon recovery. Ward navigated many challenging issues over the years, with a keen ability to find consensus among partners, the release said. His innovative thinking launched many important initiatives including the North Central Washington Forest Health Collaborative. In Ward‚Äôs tenure at UCSRB, he mentored many individuals who will continue to champion the ‚ÄúWashington Way‚Äù of salmon recovery ‚Äì voluntary implementation, strong tribal and local leadership and partnerships among all stakeholders, from the landowners to the U.S. Legislature. UCSRB wished Ward well in his new role as the Intergovernmental Affairs Director of the Columbia River Inter-Tribal Fish Commission and look forward to our continued work with him in that capacity.

Two years later, he gave college another try ‚Äì only this time with the support he had earlier lacked. He used Yakima Valley College‚Äôs TRIO Student Support Services, a federally-funded program that provides low-income and first-generation students with academic support services such as tutoring, assistance with education plans, personal and career counseling, book loans and more, an Oct. 19 YVC press release said. Wallulatum graduated from YVC in 2019 and is now an economics and public policy major at Central Washington University in Ellensburg, Wash. ‚ÄúFinding TRIO made a huge difference for me in navigating the higher education system,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt helped build a network of peers, instructors and college staff who I can reach out to for help.‚Äù The YVC program will be able to extend the program for five years after receiving a $1.8 million grant from the U.S. Department of Education. TRIO helps YVC students overcome class, social and cultural barriers to higher education, said the program‚Äôs director, Dustin Shattuck. ‚ÄúTRIO works because it serves a population ‚Äì first-generation, low-income students ‚Äì who don‚Äôt usually know how to navigate college,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúA lot of these students have been through a lot of adversity, but when they have access to some of these resources to succeed, you really see them blossom.‚Äù In each of the next five years, 200 students will be supported through YVC‚Äôs TRIO program, with individual students being served from one to three years depending on their academic pathway, the release said. Financial aid programs help students overcome financial barriers to accessing higher education and Shattuck said TRIO‚Äôs services focus on empowering students to succeed in their educational journeys. For example, students participate in a learning community from the beginning of their time at YVC in order to build networks of peer support. They also have coursework supplemented with advising and mentoring aligned with their career goals, and the college offers workshops and field trips on financial literacy, financial aid and scholarship applications, career and worksite awareness, cultural awareness and planning for transfer. ‚ÄúOur program focuses on engaging with students around their career intentions and the bridge that education plays in attaining these careers,‚Äù Shattuck said. At the end of Wallulatum‚Äôs first year at YVC, he and handful of other students in the program were approached by their advisor about starting a peer mentoring and leadership program. ‚ÄúThat was an experience that really helped build our leadership and professional skills because we were in charge of planning a lot of activities for our peers and their growth,‚Äù he said. Following that leadership experience, Wallulatum would go on to serve as YVC Student Council President. He is scheduled to complete his bachelor‚Äôs degree in 2022 and then enter CWU‚Äôs graduate program in cultural and environmental resources management. Wallulatum, who grew up on Warm Springs Reservation, is interested in studying how his tribe and other tribes can maximize the resources on reservations for the benefit of those living on them. ‚ÄúTRIO helps inspire students to continue to go further in education and in their careers,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThose connections you make are life and career connections you can continue to reach out to. There are still friends I made who I talk to on a daily basis and I know that I can reach out to them anytime for assistance and I know that I can reach out to the faculty anytime in the future.‚Äù On the Net: TRIO Student Support Services, yvcc.edu/services/sss/:=:https://www.yvcc.edu/services/sss/",https://www.facebook.com/TheYNReview/photos/a.1689695524427522/3695773513819703/?type=3,,,Timeline photos,,,,,-2.08,,,

The grants will also be used to address issues of food insecurity, jobs, household budgets, cultural connections, and the sustainable use of natural resources, a press release said. The 2020 round of seven grantees will each received $40,000 to support their programs and services. The Swinomish Indian Tribal Community will build on work to increase access to fresh fruits and vegetables by focusing on sustaining long-term access by developing partnerships with local produce growers, bolstering the Swinomish community‚Äôs 13 Moons garden, and offering additional classes on harvesting, preparing, and preserving Swinomish traditional foods. The Feed Seven Generations, Enumclaw, Wash. will leverage partnerships with tribal farmers, fishermen and tribal members to increase access to and control of local tribal food systems, create economic opportunities for producers/fisherman, improve health outcomes, and create a model for tribes in Washington to increase access to traditional and culturally significant foods. The Center Pole, Garryowen, Mont. will increase traditional and healthy food access in their tribal community, the Crow Reservation, by creating a healthy foods hub that will serve and distribute healthy and traditional foods. The project will leverage data collected via their community food sovereignty assessment and will help in retaining Indigenous food knowledge and supporting healthy eating habits that will lead to better health outcomes. Fast Blackfeet, Browning, Mont. The O‚Äôyo‚Äôp‚Äô On Wheels Program will create a part-time position to service eight outlying communities on the Blackfeet Reservation with regularly scheduled food deliveries. The program will utilize Fast Blackfeet‚Äôs existing client database to reach families and support a consistent delivery schedule, resulting in increased participation in the food program. Fort Belknap Community Economic Development Corporation in Harlem, Mont. will increase the tribal community‚Äôs access to the Red Paint Creek Trading Post & Pantry by upgrading their distribution vehicle and trailer so they can transport additional food pallets. This will enable families to stretch monthly food dollars and purchase more food and critical items locally, supporting the community-owned grocery cooperative, food pantry, and commercial kitchen. The Spirit Lake Tribe, Fort Totten, N.D. will develop the Spirit Lake Tribe‚Äôs Community Farmers‚Äô Market to support and promote community engagement in food systems and Native-led entrepreneurial endeavors in agriculture while increasing the tribal community‚Äôs access to locally grown fresh produce and traditional foods. It will also support continued expansion of their existing indoor gardening, aquaponics, and hydroponics operations. The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe‚Äôs Traditional Foods Pathway Program, Fort Yates, N.D. will create a healthy food system for the tribe. The program will incorporate traditional foods and food practices and will engage other tribal programs, tribal members, and local partnerships as the Tribe leverages, retains, and increases its traditional knowledge. The grants are made possible through First Nations‚Äô Changing Native Food Economies grant program, which is part of the organization‚Äôs Native Agriculture & Food Systems Initiative. The program, which supports two of the overarching goals related to food sovereignty and asset building and the development of strong, diverse, and resilient tribal economies, is supported with funding from the Northwest Area Foundation.",,,,,,,,,-36.0,,,

With cooler temperatures and higher humidity reducing wildfire danger, WDFW lifted fire restrictions on most department-managed lands on Oct. 1., allowing prescribed burns to move forward, dependent on weather conditions. Matt Eberlein, WDFW Prescribed Fire Program Manager, says burn crews will be extremely cognizant of wildfire conditions. Fire activity will also be limited to areas with lower smoke impact to the public and communities, and take into consideration upcoming hunting seasons. ‚ÄúBurning activities could continue into October but with the intent to be completed prior to the opening of modern firearm elk season,‚Äù he said. The area to be burned is a total of 120 acres approximately 10 miles up the Oak Creek Road/drainage. Portions of the wildlife area may be closed during the controlled burns, and people may see smoke for a couple hours after the burns. WDFW uses controlled burns to reduce uncharacteristic fuels that would otherwise burn hotter than they are adapted to withstand in wildfires. Prescribed fire also destroys invasive plants, improves wildlife habitat, and rejuvenates existing foliage. ‚ÄúFire is a natural part of both forest and grassland ecology and controlled fire can be an extremely effective tool for foresters,‚Äù said Eberlein. This proactive work is part of the state‚Äôs 20-year Forest Health strategy and is intended to support the ability of the landscape to survive and thrive when wildfires occur. WDFW lands are generally located between higher elevation federally managed forests and lower elevation populated areas, making their fire resilience critical for community safety in addition to the integrity of the forested habitats for fish and wildlife. Signs warning wildlife area users will be posted in burn areas. Additional burns could be announced as fall progresses, depending on conditions.",,,,,,,,,-0.83,,,

Fast-forward, and the Northern Arapaho TikToker has become a beacon of hope and positive vibes after his viral video skateboarding to Fleetwood Mac‚Äôs ‚ÄúDreams‚Äù was seen by millions. Since uploading it at the end of September, he has received 8 million likes on TikTok and counting. The throwback song garnered its best-ever weekly streams. And the Ocean Spray juice company gifted Apodaca a truck loaded with crates of juice. Many in Indian Country were quick to notice the tattoo on the back of Apodaca‚Äôs head, which depicts a pair of feathers. They‚Äôre now excited to cheer him on. In an interview with Indian Country Today, Apodaca, 37, said the feathers represent his mother‚Äôs side of the family. She is Northern Arapaho and grew up on the Wind River Reservation in Wyoming. While Apodaca grew up in Idaho Falls, Idaho, he says he remembers trips to the Wind River rez. The reservation is home to two tribal nations, the Eastern Shoshone and Northern Arapaho. ‚ÄúWe would go visit them [family] all the time in the past,‚Äù Apodaca said. The top half of the feathers depict a Northern Arapaho flag. He hopes to get another tattoo on the other side of his head to represent his dad‚Äôs side, which is Mexican. ‚ÄúI just want to say to the Indigenous people out there, stay strong. I know times are tough right now, especially on the rez,‚Äù Apodaca said. Prior to his viral video, Apodaca had been producing TikTok content with the help of his daughters, Angelia and Makyla. His first viral video, posted last year, hit 1.2 million views in two days. The video showed him dancing to ‚ÄúGet Up‚Äù by Ciara. From that video, he built his following until he had more than 136,000 followers. Shortly after, he decided to launch a line of shirts and beanies he embroidered himself. Now Apodaca has a line of merchandise including sweatshirts and T-shirts that feature a screenshot of him skating with juice. Public figures including musicians, actors and influencers have shared Apodaca‚Äôs latest viral video. When asked which figure has meant the most to him, Apodaca said Bizzy Bone, a rapper with Bone Thugs-N-Harmony, as well as Jay and Silent Bob. He says his social media platforms have garnered so many messages that it‚Äôs been hard to keep up. He recently signed with a talent agency and hired a manager. ‚ÄúAs soon as I signed with her [Gina, his manager], she just took off. It‚Äôs been crazy. And she‚Äôs getting excited like no other,‚Äù Apodaca said. In the meantime, Apodaca says he is getting used to life after going viral. He plans to continue producing content and being himself, which is what bolstered his popularity to begin with. He also says he will continue to encourage Natives on TikTok. ‚ÄúTo the Indigenous people, get out there and make videos, go do what you want because I‚Äôve been seeing a lot of Natives on TikTok just blowing up.

By Jodi Rave Spotted Bear I learned the importance of sharing information with readers during more than a decade I reported on American Indian issues for Lee Enterprises. I covered national news then. Now I‚Äôm doing my best to report on local news in my home community on the Fort Berthold Reservation in North Dakota. It‚Äôs particularly difficult to gather facts in this news desert unlike other news deserts where Freedom of Information, or FOI, and Sunshine laws exist. The First Amendment and the Indian Civil Rights Act lack agency on Native lands held in trust by the U.S. Interior Department. That‚Äôs because tribal sovereignty often trumps citizen rights. I willingly once helped outside reporters who arrived at Fort Berthold, homeland of the Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara Nation of the Three Affiliated Tribes. I used to think any type of news is better than no news. But, when parachute journalists, Native or non-Native, land for a minute, then write hit-and-miss stories, they often do more harm. I often wonder if they have fact checkers in their publications. Meanwhile, we need local stories told on a regular basis. The absence, however, of FOI and Sunshine laws, and open meetings held in the light of the sun, creates a challenge when trying to accurately report on tribal governments. The void of media laws ‚Äî and journalism programs at tribal colleges ‚Äî helps explain why I live in a news desert, ‚Äúa community, either rural or urban, with limited access to the sort of credible and comprehensive news and information that feeds democracy at the grassroots level,‚Äù as defined by the Center for Innovation and Sustainability in Local Media. As a 2021‚Äì2022 John S. Knight Community Impact Fellow, I have a team of fellows, advisors and resources to help me explore options to building a local news ecosystem. My Stanford University fellowship affords access to research a number of issues, including how a Freedom of Information Act, or FOIA, code backed by a constitutional amendment could benefit tribal citizens. As the founder and director of the Indigenous Media Freedom Alliance, I guide the organization to advocate for press freedom and the growth of independent news operations. Here‚Äôs a Native media report I wrote for the Democracy Fund. The IMFA, which is based in Twin Buttes, N.D., publishes on buffalosfire.com. Given FOI tools, tribal citizens, Native journalists and local media could access tribal government records. In turn, the community could take action to increase the quality of life for themselves and their families. If we had better informed communities our social, political, environmental and economic well-being would improve, and American Indians wouldn‚Äôt be perennial poverty stars of the mainstream media. How many news stories have we read or viewed on ‚Äúpoverty, alcohol and drug abuse run amok‚Äù in Native communities? The go-to location for that story typically is the Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota. Yes, we also see widespread stories on government mismanagement. While tribal business activities deserve the light of day, more often than not, they remain masked. Those stories ‚Äî like MHA Nation payday lending operations ‚Äî often aren‚Äôt reported until they end up in federal court. Corruption could be avoided if there was more accountability and transparency in tribal government. A federal grand jury investigation on tribal corruption at the Fort Berthold Reservation ended in 2020. The Justice Department later issued three indictments centered on bribery and kickbacks. Sources close to the issue expect more indictments to be forthcoming. Tribal leaders routinely use tribal sovereignty and sovereign immunity to shield the sunlight. I‚Äôve seen MHA Nation Tribal Business Council ‚Äî the governing body of the Three Affiliated Tribes ‚Äî agendas where the council meets with oil companies in closed sessions. As citizens, we are not informed how our tribal councilmen annually spend multi-million-dollar community budgets. Most of that money comes from oil revenue derived from extraction of natural resources on tribal and individual lands held in trust by the Interior Department. The local Bureau of Indian Affairs stands guard over information related to tribal and individual lands. I‚Äôm routinely told I am not a party of interest to reservation land records. But oil companies freely can access the information. In addition, our community members are not informed of the environmental dangers posed by the hydraulic fracking industry. The lack of FOI laws on tribal lands is not unique to my tribe, the Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara Nation. Out of 574 federally-recognized tribes in the United States, I am limited on best examples of FOIA or public records codes, but the Cherokee, Osage and Muscogee nations of Oklahoma stand tall. Here‚Äôs the Muscogee 16-page code, (truncated)",,,,,,,,,-0.5,,,

Anthony Hernandez, Jr., 39 and of Toppenish, had two small acting roles in the comedy/drama film. Hernandez remembered the auditions taking place sometime in late 2017 for the film. ‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt really into it at the time,‚Äù he said when remembering first hearing about the movie auditions. Hernandez said it was a girlfriend he had ‚Äì at the time ‚Äì who told him about the movie auditions. ‚ÄúIt was more to be supportive of her,‚Äù he said. After his then girlfriend printed out scripts of the lead male roles and gave them to him, Hernandez studied the lines and auditioned for the three lead male roles. The auditions were held in Granger, Wash. While Hernandez didn‚Äôt land any of the main roles, the director liked his tattoos, Hernandez said and offered him a role as a doorman in All Sorts. The writer and director of All Sorts, J. Rick Castaneda, is originally from Granger, Wash. and has a degree in filmmaking from University of Southern California in Los Angeles, Calif. All Sorts is his second feature film that he‚Äôs written and directed and is described as a comedy/drama. The film also has a theme of a romance. The short synopsis on the films website reads: ‚ÄúA lonely data clerk finds his way into the magical world of championship folder filing.‚Äù Hernandez said he enjoyed working with Castaneda. ‚ÄúHe gives great direction,‚Äù Hernandez said of the writer and director. ‚ÄúHe was really easy to work with and get along with.‚Äù For Hernandez, the experience on the set of the movie was one he enjoyed. ‚ÄúIt was pretty cool,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt was a legit movie set.‚Äù Hernandez said that while he had only a few speaking lines in the film, he was still required to put in full days of work to get his part done. ‚ÄúEven for my small role, I still had to wear makeup,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI still had to rehearse my lines. Just say my part over and over. It was really repetitive.‚Äù The final sequence of All Sorts was filmed at the AJ Strom Gymnasium at the Toppenish Middle School. The climatic finale was full of humor, suspense and even some action. In the final ‚Äúshowdown‚Äù of speed filers, Hernandez played the role of a referee. The final filing competition was held inside of a boxing ring. There were even high school marching bands on hand from Grandview and Granger as well as many extras in the crowd from the Yakima Valley community. Besides having two small roles in the film, Hernandez was also involved in the movie as a driver. Hernandez, along with his niece, Alyssa Morales who was the assistant driver, drove a truck while the main characters rode in their car and acted out their parts. ‚ÄúSo, all the scenes where you see them driving, they‚Äôre actually being pulled by a tow truck,‚Äù Hernandez shared. ‚ÄúTheir car is on a trailer and they‚Äôre being pulled and I‚Äôm driving the truck pulling them,‚Äù he said. Hernandez said that overall, he was thankful to have been a part of the film All Sorts. It inspired him to do more things he said. He‚Äôs started writing more ideas and scripts of his own and has been working with other local artists and actors on projects locally. Outside of his full time job, Hernandez said he also enjoys performing as a standup comedian. He began performing comedy in 2012. He is also a co-host to his own podcast called ‚ÄúKilling Time with Anthony & Brian.‚Äù He and his co-host began the podcast around a year ago and they've currently hosted and recorded around 107 episodes.

The event has a short virtual message to honor the service and sacrifice of Native veterans and their families. The message will be on both the museum‚Äôs website and its YouTube channel, said NMAI Director Kevin Gover. ‚ÄúThe National Native American Veterans Memorial will serve as a reminder to the nation and the world of the service and sacrifice of Native American, Alaska Native and Native Hawaiian veterans,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúNative Americans have always answered the call to serve, and this memorial is a fitting tribute to their patriotism and deep commitment to this country.‚Äù The design features an elevated stainless steel circle resting on a carved stone drum. It also incorporates water for sacred ceremonies, benches for gatherings and four lances where veterans, family members, tribal leaders and others can tie cloths for prayers and healing. The memorial, which sits on the grounds of the museum, was commissioned by Congress to give ‚Äúall Americans the opportunity to learn of the proud and courageous tradition of service of Native Americans in the Armed Forces of the United States.‚Äù The memorial design is by Harvey Pratt ‚Äì Cheyenne and Arapaho tribes in Oklahoma ‚Äì a multimedia artist, retired forensic artist and Marine Corps Vietnam veteran. Major support for the National Native American Veterans Memorial has been provided by the Cheyenne and Arapaho Tribes; Chickasaw Nation; Margaret A. Cargill Philanthropies; Poarch Band of Creek Indians; San Manuel Band of Mission Indians; and Shakopee Mdewakanton Sioux Community. The memorial has also been widely supported by tribal governments and tribal veterans organizations. More than 85 tribes, individuals, corporations and other organizations have contributed to the memorial. ‚ÄòWhy We Serve‚Äô To coincide with the completion of the memorial, the museum published Why We Serve: Native Americans in the United States Armed Forces, a 240-page book that commemorates the history of Native American military service. Native Americans serve in the military at one of the highest rates of any ethnic group, and the book explores the many reasons why ‚Äì from love of home to the expression of warrior traditions. The book is co-authored by Alexandra Harris and Mark Hirsch, senior editor and historian, respectively, at the National Museum of the American Indian. A virtual discussion with Harris about identity and the warrior stereotype of Native people serving in the military, as well as actual traditions of peace and war within American Indian communities will take place at noon EST, Nov. 12. Registering details for the Zoom event is at AmericanIndian.si.edu .

For this reason, we have been able to slowly re-open businesses and even begin to plan for in-person learning. We all must remember that as businesses and other activities slowly re-open, this not because the COVID-19 pandemic is ‚Äúover.‚Äù ‚Äì this is being done because our metrics show that our community has been taking public health recommendations seriously. We continue to see our community members practice social distancing of at least 6 feet, wearing masks in public, keeping their social circle small, conducting activities outdoors when possible rather than indoors, and striving to take care of one another. Unfortunately, there are conflicting messages currently circulating that we can all ‚Äúgo back to normal,‚Äù and this is unfortunately not true. There are plenty of examples demonstrating how quickly COVID-19 can resurge in a community when public health recommendations are not followed. Let‚Äôs continue to do what we have been doing ‚Äì it‚Äôs been working. We went from being the worst in the state and across the West Coast to being a model of what we can be accomplished when we all work together. If we mistakenly believe that we have ‚Äúbeaten‚Äù COVID-19, before a vaccine is readily available ‚Äì we will be on track to go back to where we used to be. As we all begin to revisit our favorite restaurants, enjoy more time together outdoors, and enjoy the other additional activities now permitted in our current phase of the Safe Start Plan, please remember the following to make an educated decision on what risk you are willing to take for yourself and your community: ‚Ä¢ If you are feeling sick - stay home. Reschedule your plans or opt for a web-based get-together like ZOOM or Face Time. ‚Ä¢ Continue to wear your mask in public places and when you are unable to maintain 6 feet of physical distance from others not in your household. ‚Ä¢ Frequently wash your hands for 20 seconds and have hand sanitizer available when going to public places or enjoying the outdoors. ‚Ä¢ Enjoy outdoor gatherings or celebrations with 5 or fewer people outside of your home per week. Remember to wear a mask and wash your hands frequently when gathering with others. ‚Ä¢ Set up children‚Äôs activities that do not require physical contact like going for a walk, riding bikes, jumping rope, or coloring. ‚Ä¢ Call your favorite restaurant, winery, or brewery ahead of time to see if reservations are required and to be aware of indoor seating capacity. If weather permits, choose outdoor seating instead. If the capacity has been reached, whether its enforced or not, considering going elsewhere where the risk is lower. ‚Ä¢ Continue to seek updated information and guidance from objective sources such as the Yakima Health District and the Washington State Department of Health ‚Äì other sources may not present the full information needed to accurately judge risk in the community, including the measures of community safety used by our state public health experts to determine our readiness to move forward. We can and should enjoy Yakima, by following the safety precautions to ensure we can continue to see further declines in our numbers and move towards a path of further reopening. Remember, more people = more risk, indoor is higher risk than outdoor, and less space is higher risk than more space. ‚Äì Yakima County Health Office",,,,,,,,,-0.56,,,

(AP) ‚Äì U.S. and tribal officials are celebrating completion of a $34 million fish bypass system at a Nevada dam that will allow a threatened trout species to return to some of its native spawning grounds for the first time in more than a century. Construction of the side channel with fish-friendly screens is a major step toward someday enabling Lahontan cutthroat trout to make the same 100-mile journey ‚Äì upstream from a desert lake on tribal land northeast of Reno to Lake Tahoe atop the Sierra ‚Äì that they did before the dam was built in 1905. ‚ÄúThis is a great day for conservation,‚Äù said Paul Souza, the regional director of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service who said it wouldn‚Äôt have been possible without support from the Pyramid Lake Paiute Tribe. ‚ÄúThis is an iconic species. This project is going to help get it home,‚Äù he said at a Sept. 30 ceremony at Derby Dam on the Truckee River 20 miles east of Reno. The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation began reconfiguring the dam just a year ago in partnership with the USFWS, Pyramid Lake Paiute Tribe and Farmers Conservation Alliance, a nonprofit group that developed the screens. Brenda Burman, head of the bureau, said the quick work combined the alliance‚Äôs innovative technology with the service‚Äôs biological experience and the bureau‚Äôs engineering and construction expertise. ‚ÄúAnd in the background, pushing and making sure this all happened, we had the relentlessness of the Pyramid Lake Paiute Tribe to recover the fish that they hold sacred,‚Äù she said. The largest trout in North America, Lahontan cutthroats grew as big as 60 pounds when they climbed 2,500 feet through mountain river canyons to Lake Tahoe on the California-Nevada line, elevation 6,228 feet. In recent years, they‚Äôve made their way several miles upstream from Pyramid Lake but haven‚Äôt been able to get past the 30-foot-high dam. Commissioned by President Theodore Roosevelt, the dam was part of the first major irrigation system established in the West to ‚Äúhelp make the desert bloom,‚Äù diverting water to farmers and ranchers in a region where only about 5 inches of rain falls annually. The new bypass houses an 80-foot-wide, 390-foot-long horizontal fish screen ‚Äì actually a metal plate with slots that pushes water down through the water system while sending the fish and other debris through the side channel. The Farmers Irrigation District of Hood River, Oregon, first developed the design after severe flooding in 1996. The district licensed the patent to the alliance, which since has completed 50 projects in seven Western states. This one is the largest and the first commissioned by the Bureau of Reclamation. Tribal leaders and state and federal wildlife officials have been working for two decades to restore the fishery in Pyramid Lake ‚Äì a remnant of ancient Lake Lahontan, an inland sea that covered 8,450 square miles of western Nevada during the Ice Age. The trout was thought to have gone extinct in the 1940s and was listed as threatened in 1970. But a remnant population later was discovered in a small brook along the Nevada-Utah border. Cutthroat trout also are native to parts of Oregon, Utah and Wyoming. Tribal Chairman Anthony Sampson said the project is ‚Äúsafeguarding a precious resource of the tribe.‚Äù ‚ÄúWe have to be vigilant to protect and restore what God created for us,‚Äù Sampson said. ‚ÄúEverything we do has an impact on life ‚Äì not just plant life, not just animal life, but all lives.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,-0.78,,,

It‚Äôs been a great 50+ years of being a working entertainer, but I reached the difficult decision that touring and stage shows are no longer possible.  I've cancelled the upcoming shows, and am not accepting offers for new ones. That‚Äôs the short version. For the longer version continue reading‚Ä¶

As a folksinger, I never really thought much about getting older. It seemed to me that I could just continue year after year, decade after decade, singing and playing as I had done for most of my life. As the years went by, it got more difficult to keep touring, but I did it, mostly because I‚Äôd been doing it my entire life. It was the life I knew and loved.

In 2016 on April 1st, April Fools Day, I got really dizzy in the parking lot of the hotel, and started seeing as though I were looking through a kaleidoscope. That evening the show went on as though nothing had happened. I had no idea I‚Äôd just encountered a mini stroke until weeks later, when I was told about it. It didn‚Äôt appear to affect my performance, or my state of being. I continued touring for the next 4 years. 

Then, on Thanksgiving Day 2019 (of all freaking days) it happened again. This time I was on my way to The Church / The Guthrie Center to help out with our annual Thanksgiving Dinner that we hold every year. I had pulled over to fuel up and realized I couldn‚Äôt continue to drive safely, as everything was spinning around, sort of like the old days, but without the help of illegal substances. I was taken to the hospital, and was under evaluation, when I broke out. I had an important gig at Carnegie Hall in New York - The end of an annual series I‚Äôd been doing for decades and it was Sold Out. I had to be there. It was imperative.

The next morning I left the hospital, took the family and headed for New York. And what a show it was! We wrapped up 50 years with a terrific evening with the entire family on stage. I really enjoyed it.

The following day I flew to my home in Sebastian, FL just as I had done for years, this time with the history of Carnegie Hall behind me.  My girlfriend, Marti picked me up at the airport, and we settled into the routine of being on the river I loved. Two nights after arriving home, I awoke in the morning and was lurching from sIde to side. I knew something was wrong, and went to keep a doctors appointment we‚Äôd previously set up. The doc said ‚ÄúYou need to go to the hospital - Now.‚Äù

So, Marti took me to the hospital nearby in Vero Beach.  They kept me there for 3 days, running tests of all kinds, and essentially informed me that I‚Äôd suffered a stroke. This time was more serious, as I‚Äôd lost some ability to walk, and I wondered if if would be able to play music. I spent about a week in a rehab center to re-learn the basics, like walking. I went home after that, and began a regimen of playing guitar, walking‚Ä¶ All the things I would need to continue touring and performing. During the entire time, Marti kept the family and close friends advised as to my progress, and took really great care of me. I needed all the help I could get. And she was there to see it done right. 

By the the time our first shows began in 2020, I was at about at 80% and felt like I was improving. Then the pandemic hit. All the shows we had planned for 2020 were at first, postponed, then rescheduled and finally cancelled. My hopes for a gradual recovery onstage came to an abrupt end. 

Meanwhile, I‚Äôd decided back in 2018 to move from the home in Florida. And just as I‚Äôd returned from our last gig in Tennessee, a buyer appeared, and we had a deal on the table to sell The CrabHouse. I wasn‚Äôt in any shape to go through the intricacies of selling a guitar pick, let alone a home with 30 years of stuff we‚Äôd collected. Marti ended up doing it all. She finalized the deal, and dealt with the stuff that either had to be sold, moved or thrown out.  It was quite a lot. But, through garage sales, online markets, movers and friends, she‚Äôd pretty much emptied the CrabHouse of everything, and we moved into her place about a mile away. 

We were there for a few weeks, before it was safe enough to return to The Farm in Massachusetts. That was in June 2020. Since then we‚Äôve been holed up at The Farm trying to keep out of harms way, and also trying to provide some online entertainment for our friends who were, and continue to be, holed up wherever they are. My band and crew arranged a few short gigs that were filmed at The Church, but when I saw the play-back in the editing room I realized that it was not up to the standards I expected of myself, let alone the expectations that our friends and fans had come to enjoy. 

A folksinger‚Äôs shelf life may be a lot longer than a dancer or an athlete, but at some point, unless you‚Äôre incredibly fortunate or just plain whacko (either one or both) it‚Äôs time to hang up the ‚ÄúGone Fishing‚Äù sign. Going from town to town and doing stage shows, remaining on the road is no longer an option.
