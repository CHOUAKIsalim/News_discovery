But to get on that stage, did you know he had to overcome a lot of hard criticism just days before the live event, embrace the areas he could fix, and have confidence to still go out there when he was told ‚Äúit was too late to scrap the whole thing‚Äù. Reality bites, and it bites hard. But how you accept criticism: embrace people‚Äôs honesty, and know that when it stings that means that it‚Äôs probably something important for you to hear, that can shape a lot about the successes you will go on to achieve. And one other thing about criticism- you can take it in, but you still need to have the confidence in yourself to know when you‚Äôve done work you are proud of and you‚Äôre ready to share it.

Patients and consumers hate to be ""nickle and dimed"" and with plans dictating every element of a patient's glasses with a copay or cost, it seemed impossible to simplify the process to a more patient-friendly option. Enter her brain child, Paradeyem Optical Software - a software that creates custom bundle packages built around insurance premiums so that you opticians can present a simple, packaged option at one price. The result: an increase in optical sales by 35%!

In 2019 The Vision Council conducted the first ever survey on diversity in the eyecare industry. What they found is that compared to the average U.S. workforce, the eyecare industry is 11 years older, has 6% fewer females, 6% less people of color, 12% less Hispanic, and 1% less people who identify as LGBTQ+. When it comes to senior leadership positions in the eyecare industry (owner, partner, C-level, president, director, executive vice president, senior vice president), compared to the average U.S. management level the eyecare industry is whiter and more male. Vision has 11% fewer women and 5% less people of color in senior management positions. So what can we do? Check out our podcast this week with Vision Council CEO Ashley Mills where she discussed the initiatives coming from this survey, including the foundation of the Diversity and Inclusion Task Force being led by Tarrence Lackran. https://www.optometrytimes.com/view/behind-the-data-in-eye-care-insights-from-the-vision-council-s-ashely-mills",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,-,0,0,0,,https://www.facebook.com/defocusmedia/photos/a.1259995867456717/3263921527064131/?type=3,,,
