"Who Says You Need an Automotive Background to Run a Successful Shop http://bit.ly/2v7Qcdi:=:https://remarkableresults.biz/a115/ Now visit with Brian Sump from Avalon Motorsports and Andy Bizub from Midwest Performance Cars as they share their strategy for growing their business. This is an interview like no other you’ve heard here on Remarkable Results or the Town Hall Academy for that matter. This interview should open your eyes because Brian and Andy did not grow up in the business. They were not technicians with a dream of owning their own shop. Brian was a professional football player and Andy was a commodity trader. They grew their business without the knowledge of the industry. They share their strategies and tactics that have shaped their continuing success. Brian and Andy basically became the CEO of their business. We talk about that a lot on the podcast. They used their people, network and training to learn, lead and grow their business. #aftermarketpodcast #townhallacademy #remarkableresultspodcast #remarkableresultsradio #automotive #aftermarket #carmcast #listentolearnjustonething",https://www.facebook.com/343947639147707/posts/1474449386097521,Remarkable Results Podcast,RemarkableResultsPodcast,343947639147707,MEDIA_NEWS_COMPANY,US,"Remarkable Results Radio Podcast: The Voices, Ideas and Insights that are Shaping the Future of the Automotive Aftermarket - Reside Here",2015-04-01 19:16:15,2244.0,2540.0,2020-10-28 18:10:05 EDT,2020-10-28,18:10:05,Photo,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,-,0,0,0,,https://www.facebook.com/343947639147707/posts/1474449386097521,,,,,Timeline photos,,,,,
